    ** defect bla, worldsheets with different theories in different domains
    ** dualities...
    ** expressions for eval & coeval
    ** formula for defects on bulk fields
    ** mention role of bar complex
    ** 

-- Background: 
    ** bicategory of matrix factorisations
    ** Koszul complex & factorisation
    ** Kapustin-Li trace
    ** dualisable 1-cells, "bicategories with duals"
    ** non-commutative forms & associative Atiyah classes
    ** bar complex (not yet as a MF)
    ** homological perturbation and lifting
    ** 
    
-- Bar vs. Koszul: 
    ** Phi, Psi, DG structures, bar complex as MF
    ** 
    
-- Derivation of eval & coeval
    ?? Is it possible to give a more "universal" construction of the eval map.
    Of course once we prove it is the counit we know it is universal.

-- Zorro proof
    ** Kn√∂rrer very briefly as an example of why to care about relative setting
    
-- Shadows (<< X >> = Delta x_Ae X) and traces
    
-- Defect action on bulk fields

-- Kapustin-Li proof

Notes and questions: 

-- R-charge/Z-grading: do everything for Z2-graded case, then have remarks/propositions that explain why Z-graded case also works

-- Say anything about pivotal? I think we agreed: No. Complicated.
