// README

In this document we give a walkthrough of the major steps involved in computing the Khovanov-Rozansky
homology of a link. The output is the Poincare polynomial, which encodes the dimension of each bidegree
in the final homology. We begin with example code, which computes the N = 3 KR homology of the trefoil.
Explaining this code will lead us naturally through the major components of the library.

0. Example code

option(noredefine);option(noloadLib);option(redSB);
LIB "linkhom.lib";

list linkData = linkLibrary("trefoil"); // Load the link data
int numVar = linkNumberOfVariables(linkData); // number of ring variables required
ring rr=0,(x(1..numVar)),dp; // we work over the ring Q[x(1),...,x(numVar)]
int N = 3; // The N in sl(N) link homology
printlevel = 1; // Turn on debugging output

list h = linkCompile(linkData, "./temp", N);
list cp = KRcomplex(linkData, h, N);

ring ss=(0,t,q),(x),dp; // Switch to a ring with parameters t,q for Poincare polynomial

list cp = imap(rr,cp);
list cohom = computeCohomology(cp);
number poincare = gradedPoincare(cohom, q, t);
poincare; // KR homology, encoded as the Poincare polynomial

2. General strategy

We begin with a link, or rather a chosen planar diagram of a link, which is encoded as explained
at the beginning of linkhom.lib. If the link has M crossings then there are 2^M "resolutions", each
of which can be associated with a Z x Z/2-graded complex of finite-dimensional Q-vector spaces. Calling
linkCompile on the link data returns these 2^M vector spaces, together with the maps between them
given by the construction. From this, using KRcomplex, computeCohomology and gradedPoincare we end
up with the desired Poincare polynomial.

All the action happens inside linkCompile, which lives in linkhom.lib. There are two versions: one for
unreduced and one for reduced homology; we will outline how the unreduced computation works, but the
reduced computation is very similar.

3. linkCompile

We fix a planar diagram of our link, with M crossings. A "state" is the assignment of either 0 or 1 to
each crossing. Such a state represents the resolution of the planar diagram where we resolve the ith
crossing by either rerouting edges so that there is no crossing (if the state assigns 0 to the crossing)
or by inserting a wide edge (if the state assigns 1 to the crossing), in the manner explained in [KR].

For each state we compute a ZxZ/2-graded Q-vector space. This is done in two steps:

    1. Construct a web representing the state (webFromLink).
    2. Compute the associated ZxZ/2-graded vector space (webCompile).
    
It remains to explain what a "web" is, and what is means to "compile" a web. Let us leave this aside
for the moment, and explain the remaining steps in linkCompile. These 2^M Q-vector spaces which we
have now computed form the vertices of a hypercube, with maps between vertices corresponding to states
differing in only one position. These maps are defined by Khovanov and Rozansky on the level of
complexes, and the remaining step in linkCompile is to compute what these maps are on cohomology.
So, for each one of these maps between vertices of the hypercube, we

    3. Compute the associated map of ZxZ/2-graded vector spaces (webCompileMorphismFromData).
    
We also store intermediate computations to disk, to facilitate large computations running acrossing
multiple machines.

Next we explain what a web is, and how webCompile and webCompileMorphismFromData work. Once we have
the graded vector spaces and maps, it is straightforward to combine these (KRcomplex) to form the
Khovanov-Rozansky complex.

4. What is a web?

This should be explained sufficiently in the paper.
