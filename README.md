# mf

Singular library for computing with matrix factorisations. Features include:

* Computing Khovanov-Rozansky knot homology (linkhom.lib)
* Fusion of defects in Landau-Ginzburg models (blow.lib)
* Moduli spaces of matrix factorisations (moduli.lib) 

The code is based on the paper of Daniel Murfet and Nils Carqueville, "[Computing Khovanov-Rozansky homology and defect fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1081)". Get started by cutting and pasting the examples in the folder "examples" into a running Singular shell.
