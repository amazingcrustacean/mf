Instructions on how to use lift
================================

ring S = 0,(x,y),dp;

poly W = x2y + y4;
poly Wx = 2xy;
poly Wy = x2 + 4y3;

ideal diffs = Wx, Wy;
matrix T = lift(diffs,x3);
print(T); // Tells you how to write x3 as a linear comb of Wx,Wy

ideal I = W, Wy;
matrix T = lift(I, x4);
print(T);
